# disaster-codefundopp
codefundo++ 2018 project on disaster prediction, prevention and management --- IIT Guwahati "sopranos"

The development of project will involve application of data mining, data analytics, information retrieval and circulation techniques and web development. Following aspects will be accomodated in the final project - 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- PREDICTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Machine learning and data mining enables us to analyse the available historical data and propose the patterns which can be used to develop a data model to evaluate the historical data and the natural events and predict the upcoming events. Development of this model requires collection of data, preprocessing of data and utilizing the data for prediction. Data will be collected in unstructured for from google news events and it will be parsed to gather relevant information by pre processing the data. Then clustering algorithm will be implemented to make predictions of disasters' time, place and intensity. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- PREVENTION -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the oncoming of an event is predicted from the above data model, following preventive measures will be taken up to minimize the economic and human life losses - 

  a) A mobile phone users' database will be maintained by authorities of affected regions. People will be alerted about the          oncoming disasters through mobile text messages and whatsapp and they will be informed about measures to be taken to avoid      any dangerous situations.
  
  b) Awareness will spread through automated social media updates which will be issued by the website on platforms like              twitter and facebook.
  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT --------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a disaster strikes, information about exact location, timing, losses and communication situation of the affected area and speed up the relief operations like help, medical facilities can save many lives. An important source of information is social media, which reports any major event including natural disasters. Real time tweets will be collected and parsed with the help of twitter APIs to gather the information about disaster situation and its location. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- IMPLEMENTATION ----------------------------------------------------------------

An interactive front end and a robust back end website will be developed for this project. Users will be able to give leads regarding the ongoing events on the website.
